The solution is to double-check your `tailwind.config.js` file and ensure that the classes used in the `@apply` directive are correctly defined. Also ensure you've run `npm run build` (or equivalent) after making any configuration changes.  If using plugins, verify that those plugins are properly added and configured within your Tailwind configuration file.  Correct spelling and syntax. 

Here's how a corrected version might look:

```html
<div class="@apply bg-red-500">
</div>
```

Ensure `bg-red-500` is correctly defined in your Tailwind configuration.  If this class doesn't exist within your config (or there's a typo), then add it, or correct the typo, then rebuild your project.
